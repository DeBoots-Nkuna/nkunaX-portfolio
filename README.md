# NkunaX – Matrix-Themed Portfolio

My personal developer portfolio , built as a Matrix-style experience with data rain, smooth transitions, and subtle sound effects.

## Why “NkunaX”?

- **Nkuna** is my surname.  
- **X** stands for the “unknown” in maths/programming and my **next version** as a developer.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – multi-page structure  
- **CSS3** – global + page-specific styles (`base.css`, `home.css`, etc.)  
- **TypeScript** → compiled to JS in `/dist`:
  - `base.ts` – sounds, Matrix transitions, cursor trail, Matrix rain canvas  
  - `index.ts` – “Enter the grid” welcome transition  
  - `navbar.ts` – mobile navigation  
- **Audio** – MP3 sound effects (clicks, wooshes, ambient beeps)
